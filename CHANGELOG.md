# Changelog

All notable changes to the SoundChex iOS app. Versions use SemVer with a
music-themed name per minor release — see `Plans/Versioning.md`.

## 0.3.0 “Crescendo” — 2026-09-17

### Added
- **Download all** — a batch download on an album (reusable for the whole
  library) that queues every not-yet-stored track, gated on free space: it
  refuses when the device is under a 1 GB floor
  (`volumeAvailableCapacityForImportantUsage`) and reports back whether it
  started, had nothing to do, or lacked space. (IOS-05c)
- **Library delta sync** — after the first full catalogue fetch, each launch
  sends the server's last `synced_at` and the ids it holds to
  `POST /api/v1/library/delta`, then merges only changed items and drops
  `removed_ids` (deletions and tightened rating caps alike) instead of
  re-downloading the whole catalogue. Falls back to a full fetch if the server
  rejects the baseline; the baseline is cleared with the cache on
  sign-out / change-server. (IOS-05c, was IOS-12)

## 0.2.0 “Overture” — 2026-09-16

The first native Swift iOS app, replacing the Tauri web mirror on iOS (WebKit
dropped the service worker on a cold app close, breaking offline).

### Added
- Token sign-in with the profile picker and PIN, and profile switching without
  signing out.
- Library browse for music, movies, shows and books; search; detail screens.
- AVPlayer playback with a now-playing bar and full-screen page, background
  audio, lock-screen controls, resume, shuffle and repeat, and lyrics.
- Video playback with Picture in Picture.
- Downloads and offline browse (background `URLSession`, self-describing
  sidecars, local-file playback).
- Playlists, and an admin panel (dashboard, item edit, profile management,
  scan).
